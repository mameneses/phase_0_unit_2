# U2.W4: Homework Cheater!


# I worked on this challenge [myself].

# 2. Pseudocode

#define a method called excuse with inputs
# Input: teacher name, assignment name,due date,pet animal,distant reative,electronic device,city name,your name
# Output: An excuse letter
# Steps: write a generic excuse letter with the following inputs.


# 3. Initial Solution
def excuse(teacher_name,assignment_name,due_date,pet_animal,distant_reative,electronic_device,city_name,your_name)
	"Dear #{teacher_name}, I am sorry to inform you that I will not be able to submit 
	my #{assignment_name} on #{due_date}. Unfortunately, while sleeping last night my pet #{pet_animal} 
	got into my backpack and ate all of my research. This would not have been an issue but while my pet #{pet_animal} 
	was eating my homework he knocked over my #{electronic_device}, which blew up and set my house on fire. When my #{distant_reative}
	found out about the fire, it caused them such stress that my #{distant_reative} had a heart attack and passed away.
	I now have to attend my #{distant_reative}'s funeral in #{city_name} and will not be able to complete the 
	assignment in time. I would like a one week extension. Sincerely #{your_name}"
